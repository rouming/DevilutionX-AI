maze.py - Region Detection and Navigation Tools for Grid-Based Mazes

This module provides utilities for analyzing and navigating 2D mazes
represented as NumPy arrays. It includes functions for:

- Calculating Manhattan and Euclidean distances.
- Detecting and labeling connected open regions (e.g. rooms, corridors).
- Building a region connectivity graph using door positions.
- Finding shortest paths between regions using BFS.

Primarily designed for dungeon-style map layouts such as Diablo.
